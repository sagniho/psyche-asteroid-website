        Psyche is a metallic asteroid located in the asteroid belt between Mars
        and Jupiter. It is believed to be the exposed core of a protoplanet that
        was destroyed by a collision with another object. Psyche is about 226
        kilometers (140 miles) in diameter and is made mostly of iron and
        nickel. It is the most massive metallic M-type asteroid known in the
        solar system.

              The Psyche asteroid was named after the Greek mythological figure Psyche,
              who was the lover of the god of love, Eros. This naming convention is consistent
              with the tradition of naming asteroids after mythological figures, particularly 
              those related to love, beauty, and the arts. The asteroid was discovered in 1852 
              by the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis and was named Psyche in 1853 by 
              the English astronomer John Russell Hind. <br> According to Greek mythology, Psyche was a mortal woman who was so
              beautiful that she was worshipped as a goddess. She was beloved by
              the god of love, Eros (also known as Cupid), but their love was not
              permitted by his mother, the goddess Aphrodite.
