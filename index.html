        Psyche is a metallic asteroid located in the asteroid belt between Mars
        and Jupiter. It is believed to be the exposed core of a protoplanet that
        was destroyed by a collision with another object. Psyche is about 226
        kilometers (140 miles) in diameter and is made mostly of iron and
        nickel. It is the most massive metallic M-type asteroid known in the
        solar system.

        <h2>Psyche in Greek Mythology</h2>
        <p>
          According to Greek mythology, Psyche was a mortal woman who was so
          beautiful that she was worshipped as a goddess. She was beloved by
          the god of love, Eros (also known as Cupid), but their love was not
          permitted by his mother, the goddess Aphrodite. Psyche was forced to
          perform several tasks to prove her worthiness to be with Eros,
          including a journey to the underworld. In the end, the gods granted
          Psyche immortality so that she could be with Eros forever.
